We would like to thank the referee for reviewing the paper, and for the excellent
suggestions.  We address each in turn below:

  Thanks for this suggestion.  We have moved much of the math from sections 3 and
  4 to three appendices.  This shortened the main body of the paper by about 3 pages.

  Thanks, we have added extra discussion of this to the introduction.

  Thanks, we added this reference and an extra sentence to clarify this aspect
  of symplectic integration.

  Thanks.  Eric Agol was a co-author on that paper, and so we did consider
  adding similar proofs to each of the equations.  Instead, we have now added links in
  the equations to the lines of code in the github repository which implement each
  equation, and we have checked that the equations in the paper match those in the
  code (and we caught one typo, as well as some inconsistencies between the code and
  the paper, so this was a great suggestion).   Although this does not constitute a proof 
  for each equation, we note that we unit tests in the github repository which check that 
  the code is working properly, and thus confirm that the equations are correct.  
  These may be found here:
  
  https://github.com/ericagol/NbodyGradient.jl/tree/master/test
  
  and the tests are called each time a build is generated via continuous integration
  with this script:

> Minor comments:
> - Page 3, first line of right column, "V is the total kinetic energy" -> "potential energy"

  Thanks for catching this  - we made this change.

> - Beginning of section 2: "the advantage of this approach" -> "the advantage of this approach relative to [WH method]"

  This change has been made, and earlier we add the abbereviation "WH" when we first cite Wisdom & Holman (1991). 

> - Section 2, second to last paragraph seems out of place here. Perhaps this could be moved to the end of the section?

  Done.

> - I spent some time puzzling over figure 1. Could the bottom-right-most line (beginning with -T_ij(deltax_kd# be repositioned so that it's clearer which part of the diagram that line is associated with? 

  Thanks. This figure had a typo in it, which we have fixed, and we have now moved the bottom-most-right
  line to (hopefully) help clarify the figure.


In addition to these suggested changes (indicated in red), we have made some other
changes to the paper:

1).  We fixed algorithm 2, which had some errors.
2).  We changed Figure 7 to include comparison with a symplectic algorithm
(WHFAST), also a part of REBOUND.
3).  We have added a comparison with WHFAST in Figure 7.
4).  We have updated the notation table to include a more complete list of variables.
5).  We have made some other minor changes and corrections throughout.
